# Intro
Languages, frameworks and even archtectures pop ups constantly. If you are a passionate developer, probably you spend hours per week reading about new languages, new frameworks and archtectures from discussions on twitter, to blogs, portals and books. 

However, many times as a developer you may feel lost, or at least not able to really have good opnion, once you will not be able to have a fair comparison between the different languages/frameworks and archtectures because you will read them solving different problems, or focused only in performance, or only talking about the in a bubble of words without considering some interesting alternatives.

As a developer, I belive that experimenting with new things is as important as staying tunned and reading. This repository contains some experimentation with interesting languages/frameworks solving the same problem in an complex modern archtecture.

For sure it does not cover some modern frameworks and also there will be some bottle necks in some more specific cases. Please feell free contribute with a request, a comment or any thing. I have setup a bitter chat in order to make it easier our comunication.

Although it may look to a microservice example, the intention is to focus on code implementation of a single responsability services, interacting to isolated databases and a rest api interface implemantion as well as messaging inter process comunication.
